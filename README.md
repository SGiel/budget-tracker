## Assignment
  This application came with starter code with a full front and back end for Challenge 19 of the U of A Web Coding Bootcamp. The assigment was to update an existing budget tracker application to allow for offlicn access and functionality.
  
## Description
  This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that tracks withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection. 
  - When a user inputs an expense or depost, they receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit. 
  - When a user loses their internet connection, expenses and deposits can be entered.
  -- When the internet connection is re-establisthed the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.
